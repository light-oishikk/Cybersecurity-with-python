- Created an algorithm to remove IP addresses identified in a `remove_list` variable from the `allow_list.txt` file of approved IP addresses.
- Opened the `allow_list.txt` file and read its contents.
- Converted the file contents to a string.
- Converted the string to a list stored in the `ip_addresses` variable.
- Iterated through the IP addresses in `remove_list`.
- For each iteration:
  - Checked if the IP address was part of the `ip_addresses` list.
  - If it was, applied the `.remove()` method to remove the IP address from `ip_addresses`.
- Used the `.join()` method to convert the `ip_addresses` list back into a string.
- Wrote the revised list of IP addresses back to the `allow_list.txt` file.
